# react-base-luna

This is a base respository in which you can develop react programs with a simple UI base using the react material UI library. simply git pull this and then write your jsx in your index.js file. App.js is a base component. Add as many components as required. Please refer to webpack.config.js if you wish to change your compilation and there are no current css loaders placed. If you use sass or less or any other css pre-compiler, you will need to add those loaders into the webpack.config.js
